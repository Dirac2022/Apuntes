To create an application:

```sh
# npm 6.x (outdated, but still used by some):
npm create vite@latest introdemo --template react

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest introdemo -- --template react
```

Then

```sh
cd introdemo
npm install
```

The application is started by follows

```sh
npm run dev
```

Finally, the console says that the application has started on localhost port 5173, i.e. the address [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/):
